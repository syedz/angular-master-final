          :: Tells Angular to delete reference of email from memory to make our
          application faster one binding at a time. Too many data bindings in an
          application can effect the load time. When specifying bindings with
          {{}}, they are watched and dirty checked by Angular when changes
          occur. When user's email is populated, it's statically rendered, and
          if changed, it doesn't re-render it.
